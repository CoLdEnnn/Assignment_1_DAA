# Assignment_1_DAA
## Overview
This repository contains implementations and analysis of classic **divide-and-conquer algorithms** with safe recursion patterns.

### Learning Goals
- Implement classic divide-and-conquer algorithms (MergeSort, QuickSort, Deterministic Select, Closest Pair of Points).
- Analyse running-time recurrences using **Master Theorem** and **Akraâ€“Bazzi**.
- Collect metrics (execution time, recursion depth, comparisons, allocations).
- Communicate results via this `README.md` report and clean Git history.
